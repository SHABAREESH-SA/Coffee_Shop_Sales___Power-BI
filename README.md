**Some Major Insights**
* There is a growth on every MoM sales, orders and quantity and all the KPIs showing positive growth on every month except February month.
* Calender heap map shows that Friday is the most profitable day and Morning 10 am to 11 am is the busiest hour both in weekdays and weekend hence it needs more attention during this period with proper labour management.
* June month recorded with the highest KPIs parameter and May month recorded with the highest percentage increase in sales over the last month. Barista Espresso Coffee was the highest revenue generating product followed by Brewed Chai Tea hence it needs more attention on these products supply chain to meet the continous demand and also management needs to make stratgeic plans and decsions to improve the sales of other low demanded products. 
*  Hell's Kitchen is the leading revenue outlet hence management needs to priotize its top earning outlet to improve further.
